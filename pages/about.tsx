            Hey there! I&apos;m currently diving deep into the world of data as
            a Master&apos;s student in Data Science. I&apos;ve discovered a real
            passion for this field, especially for statistics â€“ I genuinely find
            unraveling patterns and insights from data quite fun ! ðŸ¤“
          </p>

          <p>
            This enthusiasm for data naturally extends to my keen interest in
            the financial world. I&apos;m fascinated by everything from the
            dynamics of trading and the intricate mathematics behind finance to
            the systematic approaches of quantitative analysis . Lately,
            I&apos;ve been particularly captivated by the potential of
            cutting-edge technologies like agentic LLMs and how they can
            revolutionize financial strategies and decision-making. ðŸ“ˆðŸ¤–
          </p>

          <p>
            Beyond finance, I&apos;m a big fan of &quot;cool stuff&quot; in tech
            that pushes boundaries. XR glasses and similar immersive
            technologies excite me, especially when considering the AI
            integration possibilities. I believe these advancements can unlock
            incredible human capabilities and, importantly, play a significant
            role in helping people with disabilities navigate and interact with
            the world more effectively. It&apos;s this potential for technology
            to create meaningful, positive impact that truly inspires me. âœ¨
